Hi there 👋 I’ve taken up the **[GFG 160 Problems Challenge](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/batch/gfg-160-problems?tab=Chapters)** to push myself and become a better problem solver.  

This repo is where I’ll be posting all my solutions in **Python 🐍** as I work through the problems step by step.  
The goal? To **master data structures and algorithms**, stay consistent with practice, and earn the **GFG Problem Solving Certification** 🏆.  

---

## 📌 Why This Challenge?  
I believe solving problems daily is the best way to improve at programming.  
The GFG 160 track is perfect because:  
- It covers everything from **arrays & strings** to **graphs & DP**.  
- It’s structured like a roadmap, so I always know what to tackle next.  
- It keeps me accountable by tracking my **progress publicly** here.
